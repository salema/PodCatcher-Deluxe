Simple Podcatcher: your free, elegant, and easy to use podcast app.

Simple Podcatcher is a basic yet elegant podcast app designed to manage your podcast content easily.
Along with basic playback functionality, Simple Podcatcher features a sophisticated three-column layout. One contains the list of podcast subscriptions, another displays episodes currently available (for the selected subscription), and the third column clearly displays detailed podcast episode descriptions. This layout works especially well on tablets and big-screen phones. Multiple feeds are supported with this elegant design and can conveniently be searched while playing. The integrated podcast finder gets you going quickly.
Simple Podcatcher is available at no cost and allows for unlimited streaming and episode downloading of podcast content. For playlists, filters, and many more premium features, check out Podcatcher Deluxe and Video Podcatcher Deluxe (both available on Google Play).
