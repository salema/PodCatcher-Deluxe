Video Podcatcher Deluxe: your powerful, elegant, and easy to use podcast app.

Video Podcatcher Deluxe is a full-featured audio and video podcast app designed to manage your podcast content easily while on the go. 
Along with basic playback functionality, Video Podcatcher Deluxe features a sophisticated three column layout. One contains the list of podcast subscriptions, another displays episodes currently available (for the selected subscription) and the third column clearly displays detailed podcast episode descriptions. This layout works especially well on tablets and big-screen phones. Multiple feeds are supported with this elegant design and can conveniently be searched while playing. The integrated podcast finder gets you going quickly.
In addition, this premium version allows downloading of episodes, resumes to the last play position on restart and adds support for episode filters (new/old episodes). It also provides a playlist option for uninterrupted back-to-back playback.
