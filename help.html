			<div class="description">A webOS 3 "enyo" Pod Catcher 
				(&rarr;App Catalog: <a href="http://developer.palm.com/appredirect/?packageid=net.alliknow.yaspc" target="_blank">Simple</a>, 
				<a href="http://developer.palm.com/appredirect/?packageid=net.alliknow.podcatcher" target="_blank">Deluxe</a>,

			</div>
			
			<b>Notice for the users of Video PodCatcher Deluxe:</b> Unfortunately the current version of webOS has some issues with app-embedded video playback. In most cases, it would simply not show, while audio works okay. For this reason the current version of the Video PodCatcher makes use of the external TouchPad video player instead of the embedded HTML5 video option. Consequently, your experience differs to what you see in the video and on the images in the app catalog. I hope to change the video back to embedded as soon as the issues in webOS are fixed.
			
			<h2>Help</h2>
			<p>
				The PodCatcher apps are targeted for devices running HP's webOS. They feature an intuitive three column 
				layout and complete playback functionality. Other features vary according to the version you are running.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Basics</h3>
			<p>
				A podcast is a series of video/audio files provided as a (RSS) feed. You will find a lot of examples on the internet; try 
				<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts">http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts</a> as a starting point.
			</p>

			<h3>Add Podcasts</h3>
			<p>
				The most difficult task when adding a new podcast is finding the correct podcast feed URL. Most podcasts have a web page offering integration of the podcast to
				various media players and, in addition, to copy the direct podcast URL. This URL has to be copied to the Simple PodCatcher application. An example from the
				BBC would be &quot;<a href="http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/today/rss.xml">http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/today/rss.xml</a>&quot;
				(complete example below).
			</p>
			<p>
				In the Simple PodCatcher app, tap on &quot;Add&quot; at the bottom of the left hand slide pane and type the URL into the popup window.
				You can omit the &quot;http://&quot;-part of the URL, since it will be added automatically for you if not present.
				If you copied the URL from the browser, keep your finger on the input field a bit longer in order to get the paste option.
				Tap &quot;Add Podcast&quot; to add the feed. Finally, tap the new podcast's title to explore its contents.
			</p>
			<p>
				Complete example on how to add a podcast: Go to &quot;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/newshour">http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/newshour</a>&quot;, tap &quot;RSS feed&quot;
				(sometimes named &quot;XML feed&quot; or &quot;direct address&quot;), copy the URL (&quot;<a href="http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/newshour/rss.xml">http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/newshour/rss.xml</a>&quot;)
				from the browser bar on the top, tap &quot;Add&quot; in the PodCatcher application and paste the URL (if does not show up automatically). Click
				&quot;Add Podcast&quot; to confirm.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, adding podcasts with one click (iTunes-style integraton) from the browser in not possible on the Touchpad.   
			</p>
			
			<h3>Delete Podcasts</h3>
			<p>
				Simply swipe the podcast out of the list to remove it.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Play Episodes</h3>
			<p>
				After adding one or more podcasts, you can start listening to their episodes. Tap a podcast to see the episodes available and
				tap an episode to see its details displayed in the main pane of the Simple PodCatcher app. Tap &quot;Play&quot; at the bottom to start playback.
				Depending on your internet connection, playback may take a few seconds to start.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Video PodCatcher Deluxe will automatically detect video associated with the current episode. Please note, that video files are
				generally quite large and depending on your Internet connection you might have to wait a few seconds and/or experience lagging.
				Slide away the podcast and episode list panes to enlarge the video. 
			</p>
			
			<h3>Seek</h3>
			<p>
				Use the progress bar at the bottom of the episode view to seek within an episode. Please note that seeking may take some time,
				depending on your internet connection. Seeking is not possible before starting to play an episode.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Download Episodes (Pay for versions only)</h3>
			<p>
				Hit the &quot;Download&quot; button on top of the episode description to store an episode to your device. The episode will then be 
				available offline. You can cancel the download at any time, a progress feedback is given. To access your downloaded episodes, tap the
				&quot;Downloads&quot; button at the bottom of the episode list. Once downloaded, the episode view will also show an option to delete the file
				from the device.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Playlist (Pay for versions only)</h3>
			<p>
				The PodCatcher Deluxe has a playlist feature, allowing you to queue up episodes for playback. Swipe any episode in the episode list
				(center pane) to the right in order to add it to the playlist. Swipe again to unqueue. Queued episodes are shown in <i>italics</i>.
				Press the &quot;Playlist&quot; button at the bottom of the center pane to see the complete playlist. Whenever an episode finishes 
				playing and there is any other episode remaining in the playlist, PodCatcher Deluxe will continue playback with the queued episodes.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Resume (Pay for versions only)</h3>
			<p>
				The pay for version of the pod catcher will offer you the resume playback. It stores the last position upon shutdown. Tap 
				&quot;Resume at XX:XX&quot; to continue listening.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Mark Episodes (Pay for versions only)</h3>
			<p>
				Tapping on the star next to the episode title, you can mark an episode as old (listened to). Old episode appear grey in the
				list of episodes (center pane). Use the star at the top of the list to filter for new episodes.
