			<h2>Help</h2>
			<p>
				PodCatcher Deluxe apps are targeted for devices running HP's webOS. They feature an elegant yet intuitive three column 
				layout and complete playback functionality. Other features vary according to the version you are running.
				<b>Please note that the PodCatcher will only playback <a href="http://www.hp.com/united-states/webos/us/en/shopping-touchpad.html">
				media formats supported</a> by the TouchPad.</b>  
			</p>

			<h3>Basics</h3>
			<p>
				A podcast is a series of video/audio files provided as a (RSS/XML) feed. There is a vast spectrum of content available on the internet, try 
				<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts">http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts</a> as a starting point.
			</p>

			<h3>Add Podcasts</h3>
			<p>
				The most difficult task when adding a new podcast is finding the correct podcast feed URL. Most podcasts have a web page offering integration of the podcast to
				various media players and, in addition an option to copy the direct podcast URL. This URL has to be copied to the PodCatcher application. An example from the
				BBC would be &quot;<a href="http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/today/rss.xml">http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/today/rss.xml</a>&quot;
				(complete example below).
			</p>
			<p>
				In the PodCatcher app, tap on &quot;Add&quot; at the bottom of the left hand slide pane and type the URL into the pop-up window.
				You can omit the &quot;http://&quot;-part of the URL, since it will be added automatically if not present.
				If you copied the URL from the browser, keep your finger on the input field a bit longer in order to get the paste option.
				Tap &quot;Add Podcast&quot; to add the feed. You can then tap a podcast's title to explore its contents.
			</p>
			<p>
				Complete example on how to add a podcast: Go to &quot;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/newshour">http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/newshour</a>&quot;, tap &quot;RSS feed&quot;
				(sometimes named &quot;XML feed&quot; or &quot;direct address&quot;), copy the URL (&quot;<a href="http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/newshour/rss.xml">http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/newshour/rss.xml</a>&quot;)
				from the browser bar on the top, tap &quot;Add&quot; in the PodCatcher application and paste the URL (if it does not show up automatically). Click
				&quot;Add Podcast&quot; to confirm.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, you can also reach the integrated podcast finder from the &quot;Add Podcast&quot; dialog. It offers a small list
				of nice podcasts in order to get you going. Feel free to send me (kevin@alliknow.net) suggestions to add to the podcast finder.
				Unfortunately, adding podcasts with one click (iTunes-style integration) from the browser is not supported on the Touchpad as yet.   
			</p>

			<h3>Delete Podcasts</h3>
			<p>
				To delete a podcast simply swipe the podcast out of the feed list.
			</p>

			<h3>Play Episodes</h3>
			<p>
				After adding one or more podcasts, you can start listening to their episodes. Tap a podcast to see the episodes available and
				tap an episode to see its details displayed in the main pane of the PodCatcher app. Tap &quot;Play&quot; at the bottom to start playback.
				Depending on your internet connection, playback may take a few seconds to start.
			</p>

			<p>
				Video PodCatcher Deluxe will automatically detect video associated with the current episode. Please note, that video files are
				generally quite large and depending on your internet connection you might have to wait a few seconds and/or experience a slight
				lagg in initial playback.
				Slide away the podcast and episode list panes to enlarge the video. 
			</p>

			<h3>Seek</h3>
			<p>
				Use the progress bar at the bottom of the episode view to seek within an episode. Please note that seeking may take some time,
				depending on your Internet connection, and may not be possible before an episode begins to play.
			</p>

			<h3>Download Episodes (Pay for versions only)</h3>
			<p>
				Hit the &quot;Download&quot; button on top of the episode description to store an episode to your device, the episode will then be 
				available offline. Progress feedback is given during downloading and you can cancel downloads at any time. To access your downloaded episodes, tap the
				&quot;Downloads&quot; button at the bottom of the episode list. Once downloaded, the episode view will show an option to delete the file
				from the device.
			</p>

			<h3>Auto update and auto download (Pay for versions only)</h3>
			<p>
				The app will scan your feeds for new episodes on startup and every 30 minutes thereafter while running. In the podcast list, there
				is an indication given on how many new episodes are available. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If enabled (see menu), the PodCatcher will automatically download new episodes. When auto update is finished, each feed will be
				checked for new episodes. The latest episode for each podcast will be queued for download unless it is marked old or already downloaded.   
			</p>		
						
			<h3>Playlist (Pay for versions only)</h3>
			<p>
				The PodCatcher Deluxe versions also have a playlist feature, allowing you to queue up episodes for playback. Swipe any episode in the episode list
				(center pane) to the right in order to add it to the playlist. Swipe again to unqueue. Queued episodes are shown in <i>italics</i>.
				Press the &quot;Playlist&quot; button at the bottom of the center pane to see the complete playlist. Whenever an episode finishes 
				playing and there is any other episode remaining in the playlist, the PodCatcher will continue playback with the queued episodes.
			</p>

			<h3>Resume (Pay for versions only)</h3>
			<p>
				The premium versions of the PodCatcher will offer you the option to resume playback. They store the last position upon shutdown. Tap 
				&quot;Resume at XX:XX&quot; to continue listening.
			</p>

			<h3>Mark Episodes (Pay for versions only)</h3>
			<p>
				By tapping on the star next to the episode title, you can mark an episode as old (listened to). Old episodes appear grey in the
				list of episodes (centre pane). Use the star at the top of the list to filter for new episodes. To mark/unmark all episodes in the
				episode list at once, please select the corresponding item from the app's menu.
