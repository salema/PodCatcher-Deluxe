			<h2>Help</h2>
			<p>
				The Simple PodCatcher app is targeted for devices running HP's webOS. It features an intuitive three column 
				layout and basic playback functionality. Multiple feeds are supported. Feeds can be searched while playing. The podcast 
				description is displayed, supporting HTML content.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Basics</h3>
			<p>
				A podcast is a series of audio files provided as a (RSS) feed. You will find a lot of examples on the internet; try 
				<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts">http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts</a> as a starting point.
			</p>

			<h3>Add Podcasts</h3>
			<p>
				The most difficult task when adding a new podcast is finding the correct podcast feed URL. Most podcasts have a web page offering integration of the podcast to
				various media players and, in addition, to copy the direct podcast URL. This URL has to be copied to the Simple PodCatcher application. An example from the
				BBC would be http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/today/rss.xml.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the Simple PodCatcher app, tap on &quot;Add&quot; at the bottom of the left hand slide pane and type the URL into the popup window.
				You can omit the &quot;http://&quot;-part of the URL, since it will be added automatically for you if not present.
				If you copied the URL from the browser, keep your finger on the input field a bit longer in order to get the paste option.
				Tap &quot;Add Podcast&quot; to add the feed. Finally, tap the new podcast's title to explore its contents.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Play Episodes</h3>
			<p>
				After adding one or more podcasts, you can start listening to their episodes. Tap a podcast to see the episodes available and
				tap an episode to see its details displayed in the main pane of the Simple PodCatcher app. Tap &quot;Play&quot; at the bottom to start playback.
				Depending on your internet connection, playback may take a few seconds to start.
